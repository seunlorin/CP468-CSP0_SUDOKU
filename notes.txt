you also need to submit the Group Accountability Measures,

the report should include the code
, documentation
, detailed explanations of the approach taken
, testing instances and their solutions /
, timings for finding the solutions /

Your code should keep track and report the length of the queue at each step of the AC-3
algorithm.
At the end of the execution of the AC-3, algorithm, your code should report whether the
equivalent arc-consistent CSP found, also happens to be solved or not.
If the puzzle is solved, then report the solution.
If the puzzle is not solved, implement an additional algorithm from the ones seen in class, to
solve it entirely and report the solution.
